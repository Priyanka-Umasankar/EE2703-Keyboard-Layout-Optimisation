# EE2703-Keyboard-Layout-Optimisation

This project optimised keyboard layout for a given dataset using simulated annealing technique. The objective is to minimize typing effort i.e., finger travel distance. The provided Python notebook includes detailed explanations and is designed to be self-contained.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: 
   - User provides a text or dataset to optimise the layout for.

2. **Optimization**:
   - Utilizes Simulated Annealing: a probabilistic method to explore and optimize keyboard layouts iteratively.

4. **Output**:
   - The optimized keyboard layout with total travel distance before and after optimisation.
